1. Class: Frame #by halls, we repeat the same portal frame on same distance, so why wouldnt we do a loop: the usrer gives the number of repetitation nd we do a while loop with i

while i = 4 #frames and j = 2 #span 2 meters between each fram

   if 
     repeat the previous input  = true




     print 'Material = ### ? '
        if true
        return ...    
        if false 
        return ...
         
     then repeat:
     the user sees: 
     
   else
     do nothing 

#otherwise user will have to repeat the same input/parameter for different elememts many times!


2. OR Class: SetFrame: set of frames where the same parameters can be repeated(an array like)

3. Class Bracing??  

4. Class between 2 nodes: 

smth like: 

def midpoint(n1, n2):
 return Point((n1[0]+n2[0])/2, (n1[1]+n2[1])/2))

a list like, limited by a loop of points: give 2 nodes and indicate distance or nb of nodes needed between the 2 nodes
  

5. should the user enter his script OR also smth like an online tool where they see an input tool and they give it? like how simple should this be?

6. steel connections???  a library with connections (bolts and so on..)
